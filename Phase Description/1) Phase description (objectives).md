# Phase Description (Objectives)

## Use Cases
- Code problems
- Large scale projects

## Description
- This is the **1st phase** in the *Qualine SDLC*.
- As the name says, this stage is all about *knowing & recording* the objectives of the problem or project.
- This includes the features expected to be included in the project.
- For code problems, the number of points are very less, unlike large scale projects.
- It is advised to keep these objectives on a *.txt* or *.md* file for project works.
- When working fully digitally, consider storing all *objectives* files of various versions in a folder named **"1\) Objectives"**.

## Factorial Example
Let's say that our goal is to find factorial of a number to make it easier to understand.
> We would be using same example throughout explaination of each phase.

### Objectives:
- To find *factorial* of a given number.

## Note
To know how to use it in large scale projects, you will be seeing them in a future project soon, link would be provided here.
