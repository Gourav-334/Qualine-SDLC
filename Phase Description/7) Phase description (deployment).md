# Phase Description (Deployment)
## Use Cases
- Large scale projects

## Decription
- This is the **7th phase** in the *Qualine SDLC*.
- However, it is used only in *large scale projects*.
- At this phase, our product is ready to be dispatched with a build number.
- Most commonly used in versioning is **SemVer** versioning.
- We write build numbers in **vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** format.
- **MAJOR** increases starting from 1 when major changes are made to the software.
- **MINOR** increases starting from 0 when minor changes are made to the software.
- **PATCH** increases starting from 0 when bugs are fixed in the current software version.
- For more detailed information, click [here](https://semver.org/).
- And after providing deployment, a **proper license** must be provided to the as per the needs of the individual or the organization.
> NOTE: Not taking the **licensing** part seriously can result in very lethal consequences!
> Worst of which can be losing lawsuit against someone who used your product.
- Then consider researching on how the repositary (if its *open-source project*) or the general arrangement of the files used in your product must be like.
- When working fully digitally, consider storing all *user design* files of various versions in a folder named **"7\) Deployment"**.

## Note
To know how to use it in large scale projects, you will be seeing them in a future project soon, link would be provided here.
