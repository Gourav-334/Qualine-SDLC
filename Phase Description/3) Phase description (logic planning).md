# Phase Description (Logic Planning)
## Use Cases
- Code problems
- Large scale projects

## Decription
- This is the **3rd phase** in the *Qualine SDLC*.
- In code problems, it can be described in a single file.
- But in large scale projects, it might be divided into multiple files to make clear logic planning.
- These multiple files may represent *different features or concepts* present in whole project.
- And what these files contain can be *formulae* which would be used during implementation & also *detailed explaination* with diagrams (if required) about mechanisms while performing various operations.
- When working fully digitally, consider storing all *user design* files of various versions in a folder named **"3\) Logic Planning"**.

## Factorial Example
### Logic Design:
> The number entered by user must be greater than or equal to zero.

> If user enters a number say 'n', the output for n! must be: n(n-1)(n-2)...1.


## Note
To know how to use it in large scale projects, you will be seeing them in a future project soon, link would be provided here.
