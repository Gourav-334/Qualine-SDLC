# Qualine SDLC (v1.0.0)

## About
Qualine stands for ***"Quality Engine"***. The steps or phases explained in this SDLC provide not only **understandable & light transforamtion** at each step, but also **quality software** product at the end if protocols are followed properly.

## Phases Involved
### Phase Diagram

- Blocks with *same colour* are part of same phases.
- Blocks pointing each other with *arrows* mean repitition in phases.

### Stages In Order (Overview)
1. Objectives
2. User design
3. Logic planning
4. Flowcharts
5. Pseudo code <-> Algorithm improvement
6. Actual code -> Testing <-> Debugging
7. Deployment
8. Feedback & Addition

### Stages In Order (Small Explaination)
> More brief explaination is available at the subdirectories mentioned at the end, as per the phase.

- **Objectives:** The 1st phase in Qualine SDLC, where various objectives of the problem or project are mentioned.
- **User design:** The 2nd phase where the expected interface of the end product is set.
- **Logic planning:** The 3rd phase, where the formulae & logics to be used in the problem are crafted.
- **Flowcharts:** The 4th phase, where flowcharts of logics are created.
- **Pseudo code:** The first part of the 5th phase, where the pseudo codes for the logics in flowcharts are written.
- **Algorithm Improvement:** The second part of the 5th phase, where the bottlenecks from the pseudo codes are fixed.
- **Actual code:** The first part of the 6th phase, where the final pseudo code is converted to actual code.
- **Testing:** The second part of the 6th phase, where the testing on actual code is performed.
- **Debugging:** The third part of the 6th phase, where the bugs found through testing are fixed.
- **Deployment:** The 7th phase, where the final output (product) is deployed or dispatched.
- **Feedback & Addition:** The 8th phase, where the feedback are gained through users, as well as the new requirements are set.
