# Phase Description (User Design)

## Use Cases
- Code problems
- Large scale projects

## Decription
- This is the **2nd phase** in the *Qualine SDLC*.
- In large projects, it would be a broader to talk about, as it *may include* deciding how the GUI (graphical user interface) will be.
- And in code problems which in general doesn't include any GUI, the work would mostly be to decide what kind of *terminal representation* we want.
- Or in layman's language, the way we want the texts on terminal to be shown to the user at the end.
- These files are too advised to be stored in form or *.md* files in large scale projects & as *.txt* files in code problems.
- *.txt* in code problems because most terminals contain plain text feature, without any special designed format.
- When working fully digitally, consider storing all *user design* files of various versions in a folder named **"2\) User Design"**.

## Factorial Example
### User Design
```
OUTPUT:

Enter a number: 5
So, factorial = 120
```

## Note
To know how to use it in large scale projects, you will be seeing them in a future project soon, link would be provided here.
