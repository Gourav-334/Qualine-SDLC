# Phase Description (Flowcharts)
## Use Cases
- Code problems
- Large scale projects

## Decription
- This is the **4th phase** in the *Qualine SDLC*.
- For various concepts, separate code files must be made in order to provide clarity.
- Though in small code problems like the example we have picked in, these aren't required to be in **"many"** files.
- These multiple files may represent *different features or concepts* present in whole project.
- There are many applications used to make flowcharts, they might have their own extension.
- When working fully digitally, consider storing all *user design* files of various versions in a folder named **"4\) Flowcharts"**.

## Factorial Example
### Flowchart:
![Factorial flowchart]()
- Though it looks simple for our chosen easy to understand example, but at each step we *gradually* make it more detailed.
- The statement in rectangle will be expanded in upcoming phases.
- In more complex problems, the flowcharts may look more detailed & complicated.

## Note
To know how to use it in large scale projects, you will be seeing them in a future project soon, link would be provided here.
