# Phase Description (Feedback & Addition)
## Use Cases
- Large scale projects

## Decription
- This is the **8th phase** in the *Qualine SDLC*.
- This phase comes into play after the deployment phase.
- And it is a very crucial phase to keep your product up to date.
- Consider the feedbacks & requests to changes in product provided by the users of your product & note those with statistically highest appearances.
- Then you have to repeat the life cycle from the 1st phase i.e. **Objectives**.
- When working fully digitally, consider storing all *user design* files of various versions in a folder named **"8\) Feedback & Addition"**.
