# General Note
## About The Proceedings
- The proceedings from one phase to another will be smooth, considering how well one follows the rules.
- You will notice how superficial some phases as per the given example will look, but the upcoming designed in such a way to **overcome that shortcoming** while also handling the **smooth transition**.
- One may complain about the slow transition, but the whole point of *Qualine SDLC* is to provide a procedure to build quality software at the end.
- When one gets used to it, this won't be something to be bothered of next time, as one grows habitual to the procedure & intuitions will guide him/her.

> An advise to everyone is shift from notebooks to digital way of writing notes & keeping records. And as software engineers, that must not be a big deal for us, shall it be?

## Personal Note
My name is **Gourav Kumar Mallick** & I made this repositary during the time I am pursuing my studies in ***Computer Science & Engineering***. I know this SDLC might not be very good at first & might also be laughable by many. But I strive to improve them over the course of time. All I demand is some support & guidance by those who are already ahead of me in this. I am using this procedure from like past one year already & I personally feel its the best way to solve a given problem.

By sharing this through my repositary, my goal is to help those *struggling or simply straight up confused* to pick a procedure that can guarantee a good product at the end.

Other than following the procedures, my faith in God sticks me to my work as a service & devotion to God. He hints in all aspects of life in form of material level. And my life doesn't stick around software only, I am a human being with commonly found qualities & I demand for genuine connections with others as any other person would. Thanks for coming this far reading! Have a nice day!
